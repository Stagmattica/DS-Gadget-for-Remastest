--| DS Gadget 3.0
--| https://github.com/JKAnderson/DS-Gadget

A multi-purpose testing tool for Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition. Compatible with the current Steam and debug versions as well as, in theory, everything else.
Requires .NET 4.6.2: https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/net462
and VC Redist 2012 x86: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679
You probably already have both.


--| Instructions

Extract the entire Gadget folder to wherever you want, and run DS Gadget.exe.
Once the game is running, Gadget will automatically attach; if the Version is displayed in green everything should work correctly.
If it's orange, your game version isn't fully supported and some things may not work. I recommend finding a newer one.
All features are disabled until you load a character (indicated by the Loaded text).
When you shut down Gadget, active modifications like cheats and filters will be reset.

If you get the following error when using certain features, uninstall and reinstall the VC Redist linked above:
System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'Fasm.NET.dll' or one of its dependencies.
