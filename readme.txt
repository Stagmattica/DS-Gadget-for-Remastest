# This version of DS Gadget has been created for InfernoPlus' "Remastest" mod and contains various changes to item lists. 
# Based on DS-Gadget 3.0 by JKAnderson.

Changelog (Prerelease 1.1):
� Fixed title bar version counter
� Fixed a target mismatch between the Bonfires "Ash Lake (Bonfire)" and "Ash Lake (Stone Dragon)"
� Fixed a bug that caused the "Skull Lantern" item to not spawn for some players
� Renamed the unused "Gwynevere Talisman" and "Miracle: Escape Death" descriptors
� Renamed "Black Eye Orb" to "Black Eye Orb (Target: Lautrec of Carim)" and "Black Eye Orb (Shiva)" to "Black Eye Orb (Target: Shiva of the East) (Cut Content)"
� Renamed "Sunlight Spear" spell to "Sunlight Slam"
� Moved "Black Eye Orb (Target: Shiva of the East) (Cut Content)" from "Key Items" to "Usable Items_


Changelog (initial release):

� Moved "Black Eye Orb (Shiva)" cut content item to "Key Items" item list (functionality missing)
� Moved "Escape Death" cut content spell to "Spells" item list (works, has identical function to Rare Ring of Sactifice, uses "Magic Revival" death message instead of "Ring Revival")
� Moved "Gwynevere's Talisman" cut content spell tool to "Spell Tools" item list (does not work properly, usage in Arena+ strongly discouraged)
� Moved "Skull Lantern" from "Spell Tools" to "Usable Items" item list due to its placement in "Spell Tools" item list having caused confusion

� Added the Spell IDs 5920, 5930, 5940 and 5959 to "Spells" item list (as requested by InfernoPLus; these are IDs for potential future spells. Judging by the ID prefix "5", these will most likely be populated by Miracles, if at all)

Original readme:

# DS Gadget
A multi-purpose testing tool for Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition. Compatible with the current Steam and debug versions as well as, in theory, everything else.  
Requires [.NET 4.6.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/net462) and [VC Redist 2012 x86](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679)  
You probably already have both.

# Instructions 
Extract the entire Gadget folder to wherever you want, and run DS Gadget.exe.  
Once the game is running, Gadget will automatically attach; if the Version is displayed in green everything should work correctly.  
If it's orange, your game version isn't fully supported and some things may not work. I recommend finding a newer one.  
All features are disabled until you load a character (indicated by the Loaded text).  
When you shut down Gadget, active modifications like cheats and filters will be reset.

If you get the following error when using certain features, uninstall and reinstall the VC Redist linked above:  
`System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'Fasm.NET.dll' or one of its dependencies.`
